# Abstract Factory
Abstract factory design pattern in PHP

this example is easy to understand

I simulate a button GUI builder using abstract factory design patter for four OS

you may ask "Why should I write this amount of code for generating a simple button!?"

this design pattern will be affective in large and complex projects

using this design pattern, you can add new common button methods to button Class and define functionalities for each OS in their Button Classes

this design pattern will avoid Code Repeating
